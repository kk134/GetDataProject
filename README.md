### Project : Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
### Program by: Walter Kung
### Last Modified: 2014-07-13
### Descriptions:
     The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to 
     prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Program should perform the following tasks:
     1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
     2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
     3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
     4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
     5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 
### Requirements:
   The content of https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip is unzipped 
   in .\\getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset\\ directory
### Procedures
	Run run_analysis.R 
### Outputs:
   The average of each variable for each activity and each subject will be stored as
   .\\getdata_projectfiles_UCI HAR Dataset\\UCI HAR Dataset\\activity_data.txt
