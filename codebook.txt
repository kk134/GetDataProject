STUDY DESIGN
	The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ 
	and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. 
	Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency
	of 20Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration 
	signals(tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
	
	Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals 
	(tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using 
	the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
	
	Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, 
	fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
	These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
